    <p>On other rounds, you will <b>not</b> get to see the dots yourself; <b>instead</b>, you will be told what other participants in a previous batch decided when they got to see the dots. The decisions you will see are genuinely those of other workers on MTurk who played before you.</p>

    <p>If you don't get to see the dots for yourself, one of three things will happen:</p>

    <p><b>1.</b> You will see what one person in the previous batch thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">Someone in the previous batch decided:<br><font color='#428bca'><b>BLUE</b></font></p>

    <p><b>2.</b> You will see what everyone in the previous batch thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">In the previous batch:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>12 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'> 28 people decided YELLOW</font></b></p>

    <p><b>3.</b> You will see what everyone in the previous three batches thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">Three batches ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>25 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>15 people decided YELLOW</font></b><br><br>Two batches ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>28 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>12 people decided YELLOW</font></b><br><br>One batch ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>6 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>34 people decided YELLOW</font></b></p>

    <p>Note that each batch has 40 participants, so if you are told what a previous batch decided, the total number of people deciding blue and yellow will always sum up to 40.<br></p>
