    <p>On other rounds, you will be told what other participants in previous batches decided when they got to see the dots. The decisions you will see are genuinely those of other workers on MTurk who played before you. One of three things will happen:</p>

    <p><b>1.</b> You will see what one person in the previous batch thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">Someone in the previous batch decided:<br><font color='#428bca'><b>BLUE</b></font></p>

    <p><b>2.</b> You will see what everyone in the previous batch thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">In the previous batch:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>34 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'> 6 people decided YELLOW</font></b></p>

    <p><b>3.</b> You will see what everyone in the previous three batches thought:<br></p>
    <p align="center">Three batches ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>4 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>6 people decided YELLOW</font></b><br><br>Two batches ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>7 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>3 people decided YELLOW</font></b><br><br>One batch ago:<br><b><font color='#428bca'>4 people decided BLUE</font></b> and <b><font color='#FBB829'>6 people decided YELLOW</font></b></p>

    <p>Note that each batch has 10 participants, so if you are told what a previous batch decided, the total number of people deciding blue and yellow will always sum up to 10.<br></p>
