    <p>In the experiment, there are 125 rounds. On each round you will see a set of blue and yellow dots. On each round, you will decide whether that set contains more blue or more yellow dots.</p>

    <p>Each set is independent from the others &mdash; just because there were more blue dots on one round does not mean there will be more blue dots on the next round.</p>

    <p>Depending on how many correct answers you give, you can earn a bonus of up to $1.00. The first 5 rounds are practice and will not affect your bonus.</p>
