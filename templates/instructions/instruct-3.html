    <p>There are two further complications:</p>
    <p><b>1.</b> Each set of dots changes every 10 batches &mdash; all the blue dots turn yellow and all the yellow dots turn blue. This means that the decisions from previous batches might not be helpful &mdash; the dots may have changed after one of the previous batches, but before yours.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> Some of the people in previous batches may not have gotten to see the dots themselves either &mdash; some may have based their decision on what people in the batches before them decided.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It's not all bad though:</p>
    <p><b>1.</b> The dots never change within a batch, so if you get to see the dots for yourself, you can always trust what you see.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> The sets of dots don't all change at the same time &mdash; they change independently of each other. For example, one set might change after the 1st, 11th and 21st batches, while another might change after the 6th, 16th and 26th batches. So,  if you suspect one set has changed, it does not imply that the other sets have also changed.</p>
