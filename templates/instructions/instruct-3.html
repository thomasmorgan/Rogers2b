    <p>There are two further complications:</p>
    <p><b>1.</b> Each set of dots can change color <b>between</b> batches &mdash; its blue dots turn yellow and its yellow dots turn blue. This means that the decisions from previous batches might be misleading because the dots may have changed between then and now.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> Some of the people in previous batches may not have seen the dots themselves &mdash; they may have based their decision on what people in the batches before them decided.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It's not all bad though:</p>
    <p><b>1.</b> When you see the decisions of other workers you can choose to see the dots yourself as well. However, you will have to pay to do this and it will reduce your potential bonus from that round by 30%. We have set up the bonus such that blindly guessing will give you no bonus at all (unless you are very lucky), so depending on how uncertain you feel, it may be worth paying to see the dots.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> The dots never change color <b>within</b> batches, so if you see the dots for yourself, you can always trust what you see.</p>
    <p><b>3.</b> Each set of dots changes color every <b>10</b> batches. However, the sets are not in sync, for example, one set might change color after the 1st, 11th and 21st batches, while another might change color after the 6th, 16th and 26th batches. So, if you suspect one set has changed, it does not imply that the other sets have also changed.</p>
